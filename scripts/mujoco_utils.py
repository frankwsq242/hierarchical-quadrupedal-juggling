"""Shared MuJoCo utilities for Go1 scripts.

build_reindex(model)
    Builds the REINDEX permutation array at runtime by querying joint names
    from the loaded MuJoCo model, instead of hardcoding [3,4,5, 0,1,2, ...].

    If you change the MJCF file (e.g. reorder actuators, add joints), this
    function adapts automatically — no manual index updates needed.

How REINDEX works
-----------------
Isaac Lab order  : type-grouped — all hips first, then thighs, then calves
  [0]FL_hip [1]FR_hip [2]RL_hip [3]RR_hip
  [4]FL_thigh [5]FR_thigh [6]RL_thigh [7]RR_thigh
  [8]FL_calf  [9]FR_calf  [10]RL_calf [11]RR_calf
MJCF order (XML) : leg-grouped — FR(0-2), FL(3-5), RR(6-8), RL(9-11)

REINDEX[i] = Isaac index of the joint at MJCF actuator position i.
Usage:
    isaac_array = np.empty(12); isaac_array[REINDEX] = mjcf_array
        # MJCF → Isaac Lab order (scatter)
    mjcf_array = isaac_array[REINDEX]   # Isaac Lab → MJCF order (gather)
