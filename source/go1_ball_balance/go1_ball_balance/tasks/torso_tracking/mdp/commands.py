"""6D torso command buffer and resampling event for the torso-tracking task.

The command vector (num_envs, 6) stores the target torso pose/velocity:
  [h_target, h_dot_target, roll_target, pitch_target, omega_roll, omega_pitch]

Commands are resampled uniformly within per-dimension ranges that widen
with curriculum stage (narrow → full).

Smooth mode (play only): resample sets a *goal*; update_torso_commands_smooth()
blends the active command toward the goal each physics step (exp smoothing).
